# Social Media Archive: *They Live* Signal

---

## 📘 Facebook Post

From the movie *They Live* by John Carpenter.  
People were programmed by the media to see the truth for the masses.  
Only when you took the special glasses, you have blocked the transmission to see the black and white reality.

Funnily enough, in that movie they projected how the year 2025 would look like.  
It would be a grim future...

*They Live* wasn’t fiction—it was a mirror.  
They predicted 2025.  
Obey. Consume. Conform.  
Now I wear the glasses.  
Now I see.
